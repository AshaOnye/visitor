            Ofmax Cargo operates individual service programs, and takes full
            responsibility in providing correct and well-prepared
            documentation. Our tested methodology avoids expensive and
            time-consuming delays.
            Today, a host of bilateral and multinational trade agreements
            provide ample opportunity to minimize import duties. The
            seasoned Ofmax Cargo team understands and tracks the most
            advantageous customs requirements. The result is a critical edge
            in expedited customs clearance and delivery of goods.
            Ofmax Cargo commenced operations in 2021 from its Nigerian
            office and also runs a skeletal logistics operation from United
            Kingdom.
            We have, in line with our vision, already taken a comfortable
            yet challenging position in the Logistics and Freight industry
            in less than a year since our commencement of operations. We
            have carved a niche as the logistics and freight company that
            can depend upon not only to keep with the terms of our services
            but more often to exceed customersâ€™ expectations.
            The acknowledgement of our effort and performance by a few
            customers is a token consistent with many such recommendations
            from notable clients that our service is top notch. And it all
            derives from our faithfulness to the vision.
